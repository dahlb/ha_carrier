# AGENTS

Purpose
- Provide clear, repo-specific instructions for autonomous agents working in this repository.

General Guidelines
- Follow Home Assistant developer docs: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/.
- Be concise and explain coding steps briefly when making code changes; include code snippets where relevant.
- For non-trivial edits, provide a short plan. For small, low-risk edits, implement and include a one-line summary.
- Focus on a single conceptual change at a time when public APIs or multiple modules are affected.
- Maintain project style and Python 3.14+ compatibility. Target latest Home Assistant core.
- If deviating from these guidelines, explicitly state which guideline is deviated from and why.

Agent permissions and venv policy
- Agents may create and use a repository-local venv at `./.venv` and should reference `./.venv/bin/python` when running commands.
- Installing packages from repo manifests (e.g., `requirements-dev.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) into `./.venv` is allowed for running tests or local tooling; avoid unrelated network operations without explicit consent.

Folder structure (repo-specific)
- `custom_components/ha_carrier`: integration code.
- `README.md`: primary documentation.

Project structure expectations
- Keep code modular: separate files for entity types, services, and utilities.
- Store constants in `const.py` and use a `config_flow.py` for configuration flows.
- `ha_carrier` uses the external library `carrier_api` (https://github.com/dahlb/carrier_api & https://pypi.org/project/carrier-api/). This is maintained by the same maintainer as `ha_carrier`.
- Any changes that require changes to both `ha_carrier` and `carrier_api` will require a branch and PR in both repos.

Coding standards
- Add typing annotations to all functions and classes (including return types).
- Add or update docstrings for all files, classes and methods, including private methods and nested methods. Method docstrings must follow the Google Style.
- Preserve existing comments and keep imports at the top of files.
- Follow existing repository style; run `./scripts/lint`.

Local tooling note
- Use the repo's `prek` and `mypy` commands inside `./.venv`. You must always run these inside `./.venv`.

Error handling & logging
- Use Home Assistant's logging framework.
- Catch specific exceptions (do not catch Exception directly).
- Add robust error handling and clear debug/info logs.
- If tests fail due to missing dev dependencies, either install them into `./.venv` (if allowed) or report exact `pip install` commands.

PR & branch behavior
- Create branches or PRs only when explicitly requested. Do not open PRs autonomously.

Network / install consent
- Obtain explicit consent before any network operations outside the repository not strictly needed to run local tests.
- Package installs required for running tests are allowed when user approves.

CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD where applicable.

Conventions for changes and documentation
- When editing code, prefer fixing root causes over surface patches.
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with the codebase style.
